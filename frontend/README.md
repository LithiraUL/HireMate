## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue (#3b82f6) - Used for CTAs, links, success states, and primary actions
- **Secondary**: Gray - Neutral actions and decline states
- **Warning**: Yellow - Pending/review status
- **Danger**: Red - Errors/rejections
- **Info**: Light blue backgrounds for informational content

### Components
- **Buttons**: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-danger`
- **Inputs**: `.input-field`
- **Cards**: `.card`
- **Badges**: `.badge`, `.badge-success`, `.badge-warning`, `.badge-danger`, `.badge-info`

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers as **Candidate**, **Employer**, or **Admin**
2. JWT token generated upon successful login
3. Token stored in `localStorage`
4. Token sent with every API request via Axios interceptor
5. Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated

## 📱 Key User Flows

### Candidate Flow
1. Register → Create Profile → Upload CV
2. Browse Jobs → Apply for Job
3. Track Application Status → Receive Interview Invitation
4. Confirm/Decline Interview

### Employer Flow
1. Register → Complete Company Profile
2. Post Job → Review Applications
3. Filter Candidates → View AI Rankings (Phase 2)
4. Schedule Interview → Send Email Invitation
